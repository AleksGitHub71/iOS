## Build & Run the application

This document will guide you to build the application on a Mac machine with Xcode.

#### Prerequisites
In order to build MEGA for iOS locally, it is necessary to install the following tools on the local machine:

- Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) in your system.

#### Clone the project

If you are the general public user, please open .gitmodules file and:

1. Change url for karere submodule, [use this one](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAchat.git)
2. Change url for SDK submodule, [use this one](https://github.com/meganz/SDK.git)

#### Update submodule

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Download 3rdparty packages
1. Download the prebuilt third party dependencies from this link: https://mega.nz/file/tVEmQZqZ#geMefj40h0Aq6WlmJCC8iu2CiPexxhP-ZtMXSybPm1I
2. Uncompress that file and move the folders `webrtc` , `include` and `lib` into `iMEGA/Vendor/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`.

#### M1 SOC Macs specific
1. You may have to install CMake by manually building it using `make install`; refer to **Linux, UNIX** section of above `CMake` link, and run commands locally.
2. Right click Xcode icon and choose `Get Info`, and then tick `Open using Rosetta`, which can help us solve incompatible issues.

#### Open and Run the project
5. Open `iMEGA.xcworkspace`.
6. Make sure the `MEGA` target is selected.
7. Build and run (âŒ˜R).

## Troubleshooting
- if you encouter `cmake command not found issue`, refer to [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/) page, there are multiple way to install it. 

## Build 3rdparty packages manually
If you want to build the third party dependencies by yourself: 
1. Open a terminal in the directory `iMEGA/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`. 
2. Run sh build-all.sh --enable-chat (Wait until the process ends, it will take some time, ~30 minutes). 

- To build all third party dependencies, you need to have installed: `autoconf`, `automake`, `cmake` and `libtool`. 
- To build webrtc visit: https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/native-code/ios/
