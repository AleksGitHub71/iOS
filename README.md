- Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) in your system.
- Cocoapods (https://cocoapods.org/)



### Build & Run the application

2. Change url for SDK submodule, [use this one](https://github.com/meganz/SDK.git)

Update submodule:

cd ios
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

##### Preparation:

2. Download the prebuilt third party dependencies from this link: https://mega.nz/file/EYECGBDQ#2iFuoLVTqzXA2ARoNJr3tgM0eAlXoT_ce0skKycEF98
3. Uncompress that file and move the folders `webrtc` , `include` and `lib` into `iMEGA/Vendor/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`.

9. Enjoy!

### M1 Mac specific

1. You may have to install CMake by manually building it using `make install`; refer to **Linux, UNIX** section of above `CMake` link, and run commands locally.
2. Right click Xcode icon and choose `Get Info`, and then tick `Open using Rosetta`, which can help us solve incompatible issues.


If you want to build the third party dependencies by yourself: 
- Open a terminal in the directory `iMEGA/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`. 
- Run sh build-all.sh --enable-chat (Wait until the process ends, it will take some time, ~30 minutes). 

To build all third party dependencies, you need to have installed: `autoconf`, `automake`, `cmake` and `libtool`.
