This document will guide you to build the application on a Mac machine with Xcode.

### Prerequisites
In order to build MEGA for iOS locally, it is necessary to install the following tools on the local machine:

- Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) in your system.
- Cocoapods (https://cocoapods.org/)



### Build & Run the application

Get the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/meganz/ios.git
```

Open .gitmodules file and:
1. Change url for karere submodule, use this one: https://github.com/meganz/MEGAchat.git
2. Change url for SDK submodule, use this one: https://github.com/meganz/SDK.git

```
cd ios
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

##### Preparation:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Download the prebuilt third party dependencies from this link: https://mega.nz/#!ZZlSzKCQ!pCnK7UKbV3bjZvnRxkHkudcHGQcoarEE8bNlN2WDGfM.
3. Uncompress that file and move the folders `webrtc` , `include` and `lib` into `iMEGA/Vendor/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`.
4. Open the terminal and run `pod install`
5. Open `iMEGA.xcworkspace`.
6. Make sure the `MEGA` target is selected.
7. Build and run (âŒ˜R).
8. Enjoy!

If you want to build the third party dependencies by yourself: 
- Open a terminal in the directory `iMEGA/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`. 
- Run sh build-all.sh --enable-chat (Wait until the process ends, it will take some time, ~30 minutes). 

To build all third party dependencies, you need to have installed: `autoconf`, `automake`, `cmake` and `libtool`.
