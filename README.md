4.- Uncompress that file and move the folders `webrtc` , `include` and `lib` into `iMEGA/Vendor/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`

5.- Open `iMEGA.xcworkspace`

If you want to build the third party dependencies by yourself: open a terminal in the directory `iMEGA/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`. Run sh build-all.sh --enable-chat (Wait until the process ends, it will take some minutes ~30). To build all third party dependencies, you need to have installed: autoconf, automake, cmake and libtool. To build webrtc visit: https://webrtc.org/native-code/ios/
